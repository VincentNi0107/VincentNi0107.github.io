- **Master's degree:** [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), 2022-2025 (expected). Research in [MediaBrain](https://mediabrain.sjtu.edu.cn/) Lab, supervised by Prof. [Siheng Chen](https://siheng-chen.github.io/). 


## Research Interests
I am currently very interested in building robust general-purpose embodied AI systems, a field that I find exceptionally exciting. Specifically, I focus on two pivotal challenges: 1) policy with self-correction: How to empower visuomotor policy learning with self-correction ability? 2) efficient policy learning: How to facilitate in-context learning for robotics, enabling the acquisition of new skills through minimal demonstrations? 

- **I'm currently seeking internship opportunities in the field of embodied AI!**
